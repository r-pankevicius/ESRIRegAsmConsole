Usage:
	ESRIRegAsmConsole.exe <assembly name> /p:<product name> [switches]
or
	ESRIRegAsmConsole.exe /list:<listing.txt> /p:<product name> [switches]

Switches:
	/r							Register assembly (-ies) (default)
	/u							Unregister assembly (-ies)
	/regfile:[:fileName]		Export to registry file
	/f:<category file info>		Category mapping file (.xml or .reg)
	/w:<dirPath>				Keep working files
	/v							Verbose output

Switches specific for /listing:<listing.txt> or if <assembly name> contains wildcards:
	/basepath:<folder>			Resolve relative paths from <folder>
	/continueonfail				Continue execution even if registration of some file fails

Notes:
	Both <assembly name> and listing.txt support glob syntax (* and ? wildcards).
	listing.txt can contain multiple assemblies, each placed in a separate line.
		It's a shortcut to calling ESRIRegAsmConsole.exe multiple times.
	listing.txt line starting with "hash space" (`# `) is treated like a comment.

Examples:
	TBD
