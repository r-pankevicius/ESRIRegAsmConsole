Usage:
    ESRIRegAsmConsole.exe <assembly name> [switches]
or
    ESRIRegAsmConsole.exe /list:<listing.txt> [switches]

Switches:
    /p:[ProductName]            Product name: Desktop or Server
    /r                          Register assembly (-ies) (default)
    /u                          Unregister assembly (-ies)
    /regfile:[fileName]         Export to registry file
    /f:<category file info>     Category mapping file (.xml or .reg)
    /w:<dirPath>                Keep working files
    /v                          Verbose output

Switches specific for /listing:<listing.txt> or if <assembly name> contains wildcards:
    /basepath:<folder>          Resolve relative paths from <folder>
    /continueonfail             Continue execution even if registration of some file fails

Notes:
    Both <assembly name> and listing.txt support glob syntax (* and ? wildcards).
    listing.txt can contain multiple assemblies, each placed in a separate line.
    It's a shortcut to calling ESRIRegAsmConsole.exe multiple times.
    listing.txt line starting with "hash" (`#`) it is treated like a comment.

Examples:
    TBD
